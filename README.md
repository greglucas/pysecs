pysecs is an open-source library for calculating Spherical Elementary Current Systems (SECS).


## Features

- Based upon the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) framework with `fit()` and `predict()` methods.
- The only dependency is [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). It is built using fast broadcasting techniques to provide highly scalable calculations.

## Examples

Examples can be found in [examples/](./examples/)
